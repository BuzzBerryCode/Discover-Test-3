# 🔐 Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Discover Page V4 project to ensure safe deployment and operation.

## 🔒 Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Secure Storage**: All API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables
- **Client-Side Only**: Only public keys are exposed to the client
- **No Hardcoding**: No secrets are hardcoded in the source code

### 2. Supabase Security
- **Anonymous Key**: Only the public anon key is used client-side
- **Row Level Security**: Database access is controlled by RLS policies
- **Service Role Key**: Kept server-side only (not in client code)

### 3. API Key Management
- **Environment Variables**: All keys stored in `.env` file
- **Git Ignore**: `.env` file is excluded from version control
- **Example File**: `.env.example` provides safe template

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to repository
- [ ] Environment variables set in hosting platform
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies configured
- [ ] API keys are valid and have proper permissions
- [ ] HTTPS enabled in production

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test all functionality with production environment
- [ ] Verify no secrets are exposed in browser dev tools
- [ ] Monitor for any security warnings
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# ✅ Good - Use environment variables
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;

# ❌ Bad - Never hardcode secrets
const supabaseUrl = "https://your-project.supabase.co";
```

### API Key Exposure
- **Client-Side**: Only expose public keys (anon keys)
- **Server-Side**: Keep service role keys secure
- **Environment**: Use platform environment variables

### Database Security
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Use proper authentication
- Limit API access with policies

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor
- API key usage and limits
- Database access patterns
- Error logs for security issues
- Environment variable exposure

### Warning Signs
- API keys in browser dev tools
- Unauthorized database access
- Excessive API calls
- Environment variables in build output

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If API Keys are Exposed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate all exposed API keys
   - Revoke old keys immediately
   - Update environment variables
   - Check for unauthorized usage

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review git history for commits
   - Check deployment logs
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

3. **Prevention**:
   - Update security practices
   - Review access controls
   - Implement additional monitoring

## 📞 Security Contacts

For security issues:
- Create a private issue in the repository
- Contact the development team
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
